# MyMVC - Custom PHP MVC framework
A custom PHP framework based on Brad Traversy's course on PHP OOP MVC
- The custom framework maintains the usefulness of MVC
  - single point of entry (index.php)
  - pretty urls
  - better code maintainability
  
1. clone or download all files into a named folder in a web server root directory (e.g. c:\xampp\htdocs).
2. make some changes in rootfolder\public\.htaccess: change the 'mymvc' in "RewriteBase /mymvc/public" to your desired root folder name.
3. change database configurations in rootfolder\app\config\config.php accordingly.
